# Diabetes Prediction System with Severity Evaluation

## Overview
The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning project that aims to predict whether an individual has diabetes or not based on various health parameters. It also calculates a normalized severity score to estimate the health risk for diabetic individuals. This project utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for accurate predictions and provides valuable insights into healthcare management.

## Features

- **Diabetes Prediction**: Predicts whether an individual has diabetes or not based on key health parameters, including glucose levels, BMI, age, and more.
- **Severity Assessment**: Calculates a severity score for diabetic individuals to estimate the risk associated with the disease.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Utilizes an SVM model for accurate predictions and robust performance.
- **Data Standardization**: Standardizes input data to ensure consistent and reliable predictions.
- **Web Interface Integration**: Can be integrated into a web interface for easy access and usability.
